# mysql_and_tableau_covid19
This project focuses on the analysis of data related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The goal is to use SQL queries to extract relevant information from Covid-19 databases and then visualize and analyze this potential data in tools like Tableau.

## Python script to load data to MySQL

Python code was used to load the Covid-19 csv data into a MySQL database. for later analysis.

##SQL queries

The project includes a series of SQL queries covering different aspects of Covid-19 data, such as:

1. Analysis of the total number of cases, deaths and mortality percentage.
2. Identification of locations with the highest number of deaths.
3. Calculation of the percentage of infected population in different locations.
4. Analysis of the evolution of cases in relation to the population.
5. Calculation of the percentage of vaccinated population.
6. View Covid-19 data by location, date, population, cases and deaths.

## Use of Data

These SQL queries and Python code can be used together to load and analyze Covid-19 data efficiently. The results can be effectively visualized and presented to better understand the evolution of the pandemic in different locations.

## Visualizations and Future Projects

Interactive visualizations can be developed using data obtained through SQL queries and Python script. These visualizations can serve as a basis for future data analysis projects and presentations related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

## Resources used

- Covid-19 databases provided by https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data.
- Tools used: SQL, Tableau, Excel, Python, MySQL.
